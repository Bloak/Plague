Plague is a 2-player chess game.

Players take turns to move. 
In your turn, you have 3 steps. 
You can spend x step for a move of x distance from your occupied spots. 
Moves in this turn do not count as occupied spots. 
You cannot go through your opponentâ€™s spots when calculating distance. 
You are not allowed to spend steps more than you have. 
However, since your opponent cannot interrupt your operation during your turn, you are allowed to erase your temporary moves and get compensations. 
Simply click on an empty spot to move or erase.

Steps cannot be saved to the next turn. However, the second player has an extra step which is kept until used.

When the board is fully occupied by players, game ends. The player who occupies more spots is the winner.
